Galactic Defender is a fast-paced 2D space shooter where you pilot a spaceship through an asteroid field, dodging rocks, collecting power-ups, and blasting obstacles with lasers. Your mission: survive as long as possible, rack up points, and level up while defending your ship from incoming threats. 
🎮 Gameplay Features:

Spaceship Control: Use your mouse to guide the spaceship across the screen.

Laser Combat: Click to fire lasers at falling rocks. Upgrade your turret to fire multiple lasers at once.

Power-Ups:

🛡️ Health Boosts (H)

🔫 Turret Upgrades (T)

💥 Ammo Refills (A)

Falling Rocks: Dodge or destroy rocks before they reach the bottom. Each rock passed or destroyed increases your score.

Stars: Background stars add visual depth and motion.

Level Progression: As more rocks pass, the difficulty increases with faster spawn rates.

Game Over: If your health drops to zero, it’s lights out for your ship. 
🧠 Objective:
Survive the asteroid storm, collect power-ups to stay alive, and shoot down as many rocks as possible to climb through the levels and achieve a high score.

# Term 2 Projects

## The Pit of Despair
You were once a simple cube, drifting peacefully through a digital world… until the ground gave way. Now you’ve plummeted into The Pit of Despair, a molten labyrinth teeming with chaos. Lava pulses beneath your feet, shadows twist around jagged walls, and monstrous bosses rule each layer of this infernal prison. Your only goal: escape. Navigate treacherous terrain, dodge deadly traps, and battle corrupted cube-beasts and mechanical horrors. Each level is a test of reflexes, strategy, and sheer willpower. As you ascend, the challenges grow fiercer—and the secrets of the Pit begin to unravel.
### My contribution
My role making this game was that I was tasked with making the upward scrolling platform logic and making the second boss in the game whose name is Reil
