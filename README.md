Galactic Defender is a fast-paced 2D space shooter where you pilot a spaceship through an asteroid field, dodging rocks, collecting power-ups, and blasting obstacles with lasers. Your mission: survive as long as possible, rack up points, and level up while defending your ship from incoming threats. 
🎮 Gameplay Features

Spaceship Control: Use your mouse to guide the spaceship across the screen.

Laser Combat: Click to fire lasers at falling rocks. Upgrade your turret to fire multiple lasers at once.

Power-Ups:

🛡️ Health Boosts (H)

🔫 Turret Upgrades (T)

💥 Ammo Refills (A)

Falling Rocks: Dodge or destroy rocks before they reach the bottom. Each rock passed or destroyed increases your score.

Stars: Background stars add visual depth and motion.

Level Progression: As more rocks pass, the difficulty increases with faster spawn rates.

Game Over: If your health drops to zero, it’s lights out for your ship. 
🧠 Objective
Survive the asteroid storm, collect power-ups to stay alive, and shoot down as many rocks as possible to climb through the levels and achieve a high score.
